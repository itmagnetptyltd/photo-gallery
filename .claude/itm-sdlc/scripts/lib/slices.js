/**
 * slices.js — read a project's delivery slices and work out where each one is.
 *
 * A slice is a set of requirement ids delivered together on one branch, one
 * pull request. Requirement order is the client's; slice order is ours, and it
 * is a judgement — which increments can actually be demonstrated, and in what
 * order. `depends_on` gives a topological ordering, but topology alone groups
 * the runtime, the grid and the upload button into one level that nobody can
 * run, so the grouping is written down rather than derived.
 *
 * It lives in `.brain/slices.yaml`, beside the requirements but not inside
 * them: a slice is a delivery decision, not part of what the client agreed, and
 * requirement.schema.json is `additionalProperties: false` anyway.
 *
 * The file is optional. A project without one is not in error — it has simply
 * not written its plan down, and every reader here reports that as absence
 * rather than failure.
